# Arithmetic Parser

Welcome to the **Arithmetic Parser**! This Python project leverages [Parsimonious](https://github.com/erikrose/parsimonious) to create a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) that efficiently parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Grammar**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Educational Value**: Great for learning about PEG and how to implement parsers in Python.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily extend the grammar to support more operations (e.g., parentheses for grouping).
